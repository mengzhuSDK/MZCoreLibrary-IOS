/*!
 @brief MZValueDelegate is not intended to be used directly. It is used for type safety.
 @discussion MZValueDelegates are used to dynamically change animation data at runtime. A delegate is set for a keypath, defined by MZKeypath. While the animation is running the delegate is asked for the value for the keypath at each frame of the animation. The delegate is given the computed animation value for the the current frame. See MZKeypath and the setValueDelegate:forKeypath method on MZAnimationView.

 Prebuild delegates can be found in MZBlockCallback, MZInterpolatorCallback, and MZValueCallback. These delegates allow direct setting and driving of an animated value.
 See MZColorValueDelegate, MZNumberValueDelegate, MZPointValueDelegate, MZSizeValueDelegate, MZPathValueDelegate.
